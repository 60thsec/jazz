-- doing ---------------------





-- todo ----------------------

- optimize mark
- optimize ctrl-shift move area
- keyboard combos (i.e ctrl+k-ctrl+b)
- review/cleanup main
- refactor template

-- later ---------------------

- highlight html/css/text
- tweak skipstring to split on newlines, so segments can index by
    iterating, without using .raw
- bindings
  - cmd+d (mac for f3)
- double click + continue selection select by words
- on scroll, clear raw debounce,
    maybe also have a debounced jobs list to add tasks and clear in bulk
    ideally should be implicit but idk
- syntax:
  !x- skip long lines entirely
    !attempt was breaking certain syntax highlight
- syntax:
  - look behind for regexps (must be nothing, or ([=:;)

-- very later (v2) -----------

- multiple carets/selections
  - implement replace using select all matches + .insert()
- code folding
